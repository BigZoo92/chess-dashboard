Replace `hero-placeholder.jpg` with a compressed hero image when available.

Recommended production variants:
- `hero.avif` (preferred)
- `hero.webp`
- `hero-placeholder.jpg` as fallback

The landing page now serves the hero in this order for LCP:
1. `hero.avif`
2. `hero.webp`
3. `hero-placeholder.jpg` fallback
